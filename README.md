# Real-Time Digital Clock in C

This project is a simple real-time digital clock written in C that displays the current system time in HH:MM:SS format.

## Features
- Uses system time (Epoch-based)
- Updates every second
- Clean terminal output
- Demonstrates use of structs, pointers, loops, and OS-level functions

## Technologies
- C Language
- time.h
- unistd.h (Linux/macOS)

## Purpose
This project was created as a first programming project to demonstrate my understanding of low-level system time handling and real-time program execution in C.
