# Real-Time Digital Clock in C

A simple real-time digital clock program written in C that displays the current system time in HH:MM:SS format directly in the terminal.

## 🚀 Features
- Uses system time (Epoch-based)
- Updates every second in real time
- Clean and minimal terminal output
- Demonstrates core C concepts such as:
  - Structures
  - Pointers
  - Loops
  - System-level time functions

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- C Programming Language
- <time.h> for system time handling
- <unistd.h> for real-time delay (Linux/macOS)

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
This project was created as my first programming project to demonstrate my ability to:
- Work with low-level system time concepts
- Build real-time applications
- Write clean, readable, and well-documented C code

It reflects my early interest in computer science and system programming.
